## Known bugs
* [ ] Clicking to restart causes duck to immediately start moving
* [ ] Small delay needed before restart is allowed
* [x] Colliders for erased tile need offsets to center them

## TODO List
* [ ] Improve world generation
* [x] Change distance to be total traveled instead of distance from center
* [x] Consider adding something for when the duck eats a dozen donuts
  * intensity goes down after eating enough donuts
* [x] Balance donut power a bit more
  * intensity now increases over time requiring use of power
